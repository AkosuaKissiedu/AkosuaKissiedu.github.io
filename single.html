              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#1. Flexible Working Arrangements and the Gender Pay Gap.</h2>
              <h4 class="mb-3">The Gender Pay Gap is the term used to describe the difference between the earnings of males and females. 
                Per the British government's definition, the Gender Pay Gap is the difference in the average hourly 
                wages of the sexes.
              </h4>
              <p>Over the years, several countries have devised means to reduce the gender pay gap; notable among these is the United Kingdom's 
                Gender Pay Gap reporting framework. Flexible working, as defined by the British government, relates to a way of working that 
                supports the needs of an employee.</p>
              <p>This analyis explores the relationship between flexible working arrangements (FWAs) and the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom. 
                It aims to identify if flexible working arrangements influence the gender pay gap. </p>
              <p>To investigate whether FWAs have an influence on the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom, 
                the 2011 Workplace Employment Relations Survey dataset was used. The survey has been conducted six times,
                it aims to present a nationally representative assessment of working conditions and employment relations across the U.K.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Data Restriction and Cleaning.</h3>
              <p>To restrict the data, variables relevant to the research topic were selected and recoded.</p>

              <figure>

                <figcaption>Recoding key variables</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>To recode the data, observations with multi-coded, refused and not applicable selections were removed. 
                Further outliers were also removed. This was done to prevent results from being skewed. 
                To assess the spread of data within a specified variable, bar plots and boxplots were used. 
              </p>

              <p>Also, demographic breakdowns and descriptive statistics including mean, 
                standard deviation, and others were employed to better understand the makeup of each variable.
              </p>

              </figure>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Data Analysis</h3>
              <p>Multiple linear regression and LASSO regression (for prediction modelling) were the methods employed to analyse the data.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Multiple Linear Regression with Moderation</h3>
              <p>The linear model consisted of a dependent or outcome variable (Y) and independent variable (X), 
                the coefficient of the independent variable (βnth) and a constant value (β0). 
                The constant value represents the dependent variable if the independent variables are all 0 values.
                The linear regression created took the format y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 ……… + μ.
                The outcome variable, numeric in nature, was an employee's average yearly pay before tax and deductions, 
                these values were calculated from gross salary ranges given within the data set. 
                Multiple independent variables were used; these variables included age, gender, ethnicity, 
                marital status, level of education and others.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="images/image_10.png" alt="Examining the relationship between some indepedent variables and the outcome variable" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>Examining the relationship between some indepedent variables and the outcome variable</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>With multiple linear regression, the goal was to understand the influence of Flexible Working Arrangements 
                and other variables (independent variable) on an employee's gross pay (outcome variable).
              </p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Moderation</h3>
              <p>Moderation explores the impact of a variable on the relationship between an outcome and independent variables. 
                Using moderation, the study explored how Flexible Working Arrangement based variables influenced
                the relationship between an employee's gross pay (outcome variable) and the other key independent variables.
              </p>

                <figcaption>Multiple Linear Regression with Moderation results</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypotheses Testing</h3>
              <p>To better explore the influence of the independent variables on the outcome variable, 
                some hypotheses were generated. The goal was to reject, or fail to reject, the stated hypothesis 
                based on a p-value (i.e. a value that shows the significance of the stated hypothesis.)
              </p>

              <p>The hypotheses generated were as follows:</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypothesis One</h5>
              <p>H0: Gender does not negatively influence a female employee's earning ability.</p>
              <p>H1: Gender negatively influences a female employee's earning ability and thus affects the gender pay gap.</p>
                    
              <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypothesis Two</h5>
              <p>H0: Education does not increase a female employee's earning ability.</p>
              <p>H1: Education increases a female employee's earning ability and thus affects the gender pay gap.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypothesis Three</h5>
              <p>H0: Age does not influence a female employee's earning abilities.</p>
              <p>H1: Age influences a female employee's earning abilities and thus affects the gender pay gap.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypothesis Four</h5>
              <p>H0: Having dependent children does not impact a woman's earning ability.</p>
              <p>H1: Having dependent children impacts a woman's earning ability and contributes to widening the gender pay gap.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hypothesis Five</h5>
              <p>H0: An employee's use of, or the availability of, flexible working arrangements does not influence an employee's earning ability.</p>
              <p>H1: An employee's use of, or the availability of, flexible working arrangements influences an employee's earning ability, thus, influencing the gender pay gap.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Prediction Modelling and LASSO Regression</h3>
              <p>Prediction modelling facilitates the calculation of coefficients which can be applied to the data sample to 
                estimate the outcome variables. The accuracy of the coefficients relies heavily on the relevance of the explanatory 
                variables used. The prediction model used is the LASSO regression.
              </p>

              <p>LASSO regressions automatically selects the most relevant variables for prediction model creation.
                With Lasso regression, the goal was to identify how relevant each of the selected independent variables 
                were in predicting the outcome variable. This way we could identify, how important the Flexible Working Arrangement
                variables were in predicting an employee's gross pay. 
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="images/image_12.png" alt="LASSO regression- Important Variables" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>LASSO regression- Important Variables</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Results</h3>
              <p>The results from the multiple linear regression showed that ane employee's gender, age and level of education (independent variables ) influenced their pay. Bringing Flexible working arrangement variables into the mix, the multiple linear regression revealed that, employees who utilised FWA’s which influenced the number of hours an employee worked had significant influence on their pay.
                From the prediction model (LASSO regression) Flexible working arrangement variables do not significantly improve a model's ability to predict pay accurately.
              </p>
                    
              <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Limitations</h3>
              <p>It is important to note that, the demographic analysis of the data set showed that, the respondents were 
                predominantly of white ethnicity, between the ages of 22-49, 
                married or living with a partner and with GCE or GCSE qualifications. Due to the makeup of the sample, 
                it is difficult to generalise the findings of the models across the workforce in the UK because, the workforce is
                multicultural.

              <h4 class="mb-3">To assess the performance in a call center, a dataset containing some key performance metrics was cleaned
                and analysed. An interactive dashboard was created to visualise the dataset.
              </h4>
              <p>The goal of this analysis was to understand performance in a call centre. 
                There were originally, 2 separate datasets, one with agent data and the other with call data. 
                The data was merged so that, each call could be identified by the agent who received the call.

              </figure>

              <p>The data was cleaned, and pivot tables and charts were generated 
                to explore customer satisfaction, performance by gender, specifically, 
                how many calls each were responded to by agent gender, also which gender 
                had the most and least forwarded calls. Trends around call length by time 
                of day were also investigated.
              </p>

              <p>These pivot charts were put together in an interactive dashboard.</p>
